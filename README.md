PLDA
=========
**Open-source implementation of simplified PLDA (Probabilistic Linear Discriminant Analysis)**

PLDA is a probabilistic version of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). This technique projects the input data into a much lower dimensional space with minimal loss of discriminative ability, as the ratio of between-classe and within-class variations is maximized.
